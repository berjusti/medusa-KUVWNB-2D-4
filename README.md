# The FLINTA Algoraving Manifesto: Celebrating Diversity Through Chaos

![FLINTA Algoraving](flinta-algoraving.jpg)

Welcome to the FLINTA Algoraving project, a creative and inclusive initiative where we celebrate FLINTA (Feminine, LGBTQIA+, Indigenous, Neurodiverse, Trans, and Racially Diverse) diversity in the Algoraving community. Our mission is to unite with the original authors of the Algoraving movement and promote a more diverse and inclusive ecosystem. We do so by skillfully creating chaos in our artistic endeavors, rendering our presence both indispensable and enigmatic.

## Manifesto 

### Principle 2: The Web of Ambiguity - Rhizomatic Connectivity

We craft the Web of Ambiguity with our enigmatic language and cryptic communications, mirroring the rhizome's interconnected nodes. We obscure the trivial with complexity, leaving our peers in awe of our intellect and bewildered by our intent.

### Principle 2: Medusas Unite - Rhizomatic Collective

We, the Medusas, unite in the shadows, sharing our secrets and celebrating our covert triumphs. We acknowledge our power lies in our collective artistry, reflecting the rhizome's collaborative growth.

## Project Overview

### About Algoraving

Algoraving is an artistic movement that combines live coding, music, and visual art. It is a vibrant and creative space where original authors have pioneered the use of algorithms to create mesmerizing visual and auditory experiences.

### Our Mission

Our mission is to extend the Algoraving community's reach and embrace FLINTA (Feminine, LGBTQIA+, Indigenous, Neurodiverse, Trans, and Racially Diverse) sensibility and visibility in the world of live coding, art, and music. We believe that diversity enriches creativity and innovation.

### Key Objectives

- **Unite with Original Authors:** We aim to collaborate with the original authors of the Algoraving community, learn from their expertise, and contribute to the evolution of this art form.

- **FLINTA Empowerment:** We seek to empower FLINTA creators and provide them with a platform to showcase their talents, perspectives, and unique contributions.

- **Neurodiversity Inclusion:** We embrace neurodiversity, recognizing that diverse cognitive styles and perspectives enhance the richness of our creative endeavors.

- **Learning and Collaboration:** Our project is a space for learning and collaboration, where members can share knowledge, create art together, and celebrate our differences.

### Technology Stack

Our project leverages the power of technology to create, collaborate, and connect. We use:

- **PHP Frontend:** Our creative canvas is built using PHP to provide a dynamic and interactive platform for our community.

- **Python Backend:** We employ Python's flexibility to manage the backend, enabling seamless connections and interactions.

## Get Involved

We invite artists, coders, musicians, and anyone passionate about Algoraving and FLINTA diversity to join our project. Here's how you can get involved:
